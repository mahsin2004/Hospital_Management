## üóÉÔ∏è Database Structure

The system is built on a relational database (`hospital_db`) with the following tables:

- **Users**: System users with authentication information
- **Patients**: Patient demographic and contact information
- **Doctors**: Doctor profiles with specialization details
- **Appointments**: Scheduled appointments between doctors and patients
- **LabTests**: Laboratory tests ordered for patients
- **LabTestReports**: Storage for laboratory test result files

## üîé Query Functionality

Our hospital management system features a powerful and flexible query system that allows users to search and filter data across all database tables. This functionality is vital for healthcare professionals to quickly access critical information.

### Query Features:

#### Basic Querying
- **Patient Search**: Find patients by name, ID, phone number, or age
- **Doctor Search**: Find doctors by name, specialization, or ID
- **Appointment Lookup**: Search by date range, status, doctor, or patient
- **Lab Test Filtering**: Filter by test name, status, date range, or patient

#### Advanced Query Options
- **Multi-parameter Search**: Combine multiple search criteria for precise results
- **Wildcard Support**: Use partial matches to find records with incomplete information
- **Date Range Queries**: Filter appointments or lab tests within specific time periods
- **Status-based Filtering**: Find all appointments or tests with particular statuses

#### Query Implementation

The query system is implemented through a combination of:

1. **Frontend Search Interface**: User-friendly forms with auto-complete functionality
2. **API Endpoints**: RESTful endpoints that accept query parameters
3. **Database Layer**: Optimized SQL queries with prepared statements for security

#### Example Query Use Cases:

1. Find all appointments for a specific doctor on a given date
```sql
SELECT a.*, p.Name as PatientName 
FROM Appointments a
JOIN Patients p ON a.PatientID = p.PatientID
WHERE a.DoctorID = ? AND a.AppointmentDate = ?
ORDER BY a.AppointmentTime;
```

2. Find all pending lab tests for a specific patient
```sql
SELECT l.*, p.Name as PatientName
FROM LabTests l
JOIN Patients p ON l.PatientID = p.PatientID
WHERE l.Status = 'Pending' AND l.PatientID = ?;
```

3. Find all patients with appointments in the next week
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT p.*
FROM Patients p
JOIN Appointments a ON p.PatientID = a.PatientID
WHERE a.AppointmentDate BETWEEN CURDATE() AND DATE_ADD(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);
```

4. Search for patients by partial name match
```sql
SELECT * FROM Patients 
WHERE Name LIKE CONCAT('%', ?, '%');
```

#### Performance Considerations

The query system includes:
- **Indexed Fields**: Critical search fields are indexed for faster retrieval
- **Query Caching**: Frequent queries are cached to reduce database load
- **Pagination**: Large result sets are paginated to improve performance
- **Query Optimization**: Queries are optimized for the database engine
